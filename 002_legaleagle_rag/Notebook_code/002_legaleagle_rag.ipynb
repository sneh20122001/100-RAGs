He was earlier granted bail for IPC sections. Later, serious sections under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act were added, and NIA sought his re-arrest. The Special Court directed custody, rejecting his prayer to continue on earlier bail.\\n\\n['Whether fresh bail is needed when new, more serious penal sections are added', 'Whether cancellation of earlier bail is required due to lack of jurisdiction', 'Powers of the Special Court under NIA Act to take cognizance and grant bail']\\n\\nThe court held that newly added serious UA(P) Act offences required separate consideration and the Special Judge could not continue prior bail orders granted under IPC sections. Hence, fresh bail was required, and custody was ordered.\\n\\nBail earlier granted to Jibangshu Paul under IPC sections was cancelled after UA(P) Act sections were added. Court ruled fresh bail was needed for the added serious offences.\", \"The case involves custodial rape of a woman by multiple accused including police officials. The trial court convicted several accused under IPC sections for rape and related offences. Accused were on bail during investigation and trial. After conviction, some accused got bail under suspension of sentence, which the prosecution challenged seeking cancellation.\\n\\n['Whether suspension of sentence requires detailed reasons under Section 389(1) CrPC', 'Whether bail granted post-conviction can be cancelled under Section 439(2) CrPC', 'What are the relevant considerations in cancelling bail post-conviction']\\n\\nThe court held that due to the grave nature of the offence (custodial rape), impact on victim and society, and high punishment awarded, continuation of bail would not be justified. There was no reason to believe that the conviction was unsustainable at this stage, and hence bail was cancelled and further relief denied.\\n\\nMadras High Court cancelled the bail granted to four convicted accused in a custodial rape case and rejected bail for two others, citing gravity of offence and societal impact.\", \"Hyderali, a government contractor, was accused in a large-scale economic fraud involving forged petroleum bills used to claim government money. Fake bills allegedly prepared by the first accused were used by various officials and contractors, including Hyderali, to claim crores from the exchequer. The first accused died under suspicious circumstances after giving detailed confessions.\\n\\n['Whether anticipatory bail can be granted when similarly placed co-accused were granted bail', 'Whether custodial interrogation is necessary in economic offences involving documentary evidence', 'Whether parity in bail can override the gravity of allegations and investigative needs']\\n\\nThe court ruled that despite other co-accused getting anticipatory bail, the petitioner could not be treated similarly due to the serious nature of allegations, need for custodial interrogation, and discovery of systemic sabotage of investigation. The court emphasized that custodial interrogation is a legitimate investigative tool and anticipatory bail cannot be granted solely based on parity.\\n\\nKerala High Court rejected anticipatory bail for a contractor accused in a massive forged bill scam, citing the need for custodial interrogation and gravity of offence despite parity claims.\", \"The petitioner, a government employee, alleged that he was brutally tortured and castrated in police custody by multiple officers due to his involvement in an agitation. Indrajit Mukherjee, then OC of Kalna PS, was among those charged. The petitioner sought cancellation of bail granted to Mukherjee, alleging post-release intimidation.\\n\\n['Whether bail should be cancelled under Section 439(2) CrPC due to post-release threats and misuse of liberty', 'Whether the grant of interim and confirmed bail without referencing prior anticipatory bail rejection was improper', 'What constitutes cogent and overwhelming grounds for bail cancellation']\\n\\nThe court found no cogent or overwhelming reason to cancel bail, noting that the alleged threats did not directly impact trial or investigation. Despite serious allegations, absence of new evidence of misuse of liberty meant bail could not be revoked.\\n\\nCalcutta High Court refused to cancel bail of a police officer accused in a custodial torture case, citing lack of compelling new grounds or threat to justice.\", \"Shankri Devi and co-accused were charged with the murder of Sita Devi, allegedly beaten to death by Mangal Singh with support from others including the petitioner. Petitioners sought review of the High Court's earlier order rejecting bail, citing overlooked witness testimony and their gender-based entitlement under Section 437 CrPC.\\n\\n['Whether the court’s earlier bail rejection order contained errors apparent on the face of the record', 'Whether female accused are entitled to bail under proviso to Section 437 CrPC', 'Whether review of bail order under Section 362 CrPC is maintainable']\\n\\nThe court held that its earlier rejection of bail was reasoned and based on witness testimonies. No clerical or apparent legal error warranted review. It emphasized that being a woman accused in a serious offence like murder does not automatically justify bail.\\n\\nJammu & Kashmir High Court rejected the review plea for bail in a murder case, affirming its prior order and holding that no legal error existed to justify reconsideration.\", \"Hardeep Singh @ Dipi, a juvenile, was implicated in a gang-related robbery and murder based on co-accused confessions. He had been in a juvenile protection home for almost a year. Previous courts denied bail citing societal risk and psychological harm. The High Court reversed this, applying the JJ Act’s presumption in favour of bail for children.\\n\\n['Whether Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice Act mandates bail unless specific exceptions apply', 'Whether association with adult co-accused justifies continued detention of a juvenile', 'Whether heinousness of the offence overrides statutory bail rights under the JJ Act']\\n\\nThe court emphasized that Section 12 of the JJ Act mandates bail for juveniles unless release would expose them to danger or defeat justice. The petitioner had not inflicted fatal injuries and co-accused were already in custody, so no such danger remained. Detention beyond one year was held unjustified.\\n\\nPunjab & Haryana High Court granted bail to a juvenile accused in a murder case, ruling that prolonged detention violated Section 12 of the JJ Act since no continuing risk or injustice was found.\", \"Bharath Kumar was accused of conspiring to murder Harish by paying 'supari' to co-accused. He was absconding after his anticipatory bail was denied and surrendered only months later. He allegedly failed to cooperate with police, and the case involves joint recovery of blood-stained weapons linking accused to the crime.\\n\\n['Whether the petitioner, being the main conspirator, is entitled to bail on parity with co-accused', 'Whether prolonged abscondence and non-cooperation affects bail eligibility', 'Whether discretionary bail can be denied despite other accused getting bail']\\n\\nThe court found that the accused was the main conspirator who paid for the murder, remained absconding, and failed to cooperate in investigation. Parity with co-accused was rejected since those granted bail had less direct roles. Court emphasized the gravity of conspiracy and potential threat to witnesses.\\n\\nKarnataka High Court rejected bail to the alleged mastermind in a murder-for-hire case, citing his absconding, role in the crime, and lack of cooperation with investigators.\", \"Petitioners, police personnel, were accused of murdering a suspect named Guddappa in custody at Ranebennur Police Station. The defense argued no prima facie evidence existed for a murder charge and sought anticipatory bail, contending it should at most be a case under Section 330 IPC. The court held the investigation was still ongoing and applied the Supreme Court's ruling that anticipatory bail should not be granted in murder cases during incomplete investigation.\\n\\n['Whether anticipatory bail can be granted in a custodial murder case with ongoing investigation', 'Whether Section 438 CrPC empowers courts to override public interest and procedural considerations', 'Interpretation of Supreme Court rulings as binding precedent under Article 141']\\n\\nThe court found that the case involved custodial death under investigation by a specialized unit. Following the precedent in Kiran Devi v. State of Rajasthan, the court held anticipatory bail is impermissible in murder cases during incomplete investigation and emphasized judicial discipline under Article 141 of the Constitution.\\n\\nKarnataka High Court denied anticipatory bail to police officers accused of custodial murder, citing binding precedent against such bail when investigation is ongoing.\", \"Aslam Babalal Desai was arrested in connection with a murder case and granted default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC due to failure by the police to file the charge-sheet within 90 days. The State later filed the charge-sheet and sought cancellation of bail under Section 439(2). The High Court cancelled the bail, which was challenged before the Supreme Court.\\n\\n['Whether default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC can be cancelled solely on filing of the charge-sheet', 'Whether bail under Section 167(2) is deemed to be under Chapter XXXIII and subject to cancellation under Sections 437(5) or 439(2)', 'Whether liberty granted due to prosecutorial delay can be easily revoked']\\n\\nThe Court held that bail granted under Section 167(2) cannot be cancelled merely due to the filing of the charge-sheet. Cancellation must be based on valid grounds like tampering with evidence, threat to witnesses, or likelihood of fleeing. Legislative intent was to instil urgency in investigation and protect individual liberty.\\n\\nSupreme Court ruled that default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC cannot be cancelled merely upon charge-sheet filing; special grounds are required to justify such cancellation.\", \"The petitioner was arrested with 6.71 grams of heroin along with two others during a police chase. The heroin was confirmed by a forensic report. The petitioner had prior NDPS cases, but no details were provided. Bail was sought under Section 439 CrPC after charge-sheet was filed.\\n\\n['Whether judicial custody serves any purpose in NDPS cases involving intermediate quantity', 'Whether rigours of Section 37 NDPS Act apply to intermediate quantity', 'Whether prior cases without detailed status preclude bail']\\n\\nThe court noted that the quantity was intermediate and not commercial, hence Section 37 did not apply.

No evidence showed he actively participated in the assault or was part of a structured crime syndicate. Therefore, Section 21(4) MCOC did not bar bail.\\n\\nBombay High Court granted regular bail to Shiban Shafi Shaikh, holding that the MCOC bar did not apply as no prima facie material showed gang membership.

The raid led to the recovery of 93.9 kg of dry cannabis leaves stored in plastic drums and bags.
