The 4 degrees scenario also demonstrated that IAG would incur additional operating costs, but in this case, these would more likely arise from increased cost of operational disruption due to increased frequency of extreme weather events.', 'Climate change potentially has multiple effects that could harm the Group’s operations. The increasing scarcity of water resources may negatively affect the Group’s operations in some regions of the world, high sea levels may harm certain coastal activities, and the multiplication of extreme weather events may damage offshore and onshore facilities. These climate risk factors are continually assessed in the risk management and prevention plans.', 'This structured approach applies to all of the Group’s operated businesses exposed to these risks. In addition to its drilling and pipeline transport operations, the Group has at the end of 2018 195 sites and operating zones exposed to major technological risks, which could cause harm or damage to people, property and the environment, corresponding to:', 'Emission sources not reported This section of the report details the emission sources on which we have not reported and provides the reasons behind our decisions. Only a minority of the offices we operate directly make use of gas and we have included this in our emissions from combustion of fuel. We do not have distinct data on heat/steam for our other offices as this is most likely embedded in the office service charges that we pay. As a result, we have not currently reported on purchased heat or steam. In future we will devise a methodology to estimate the emissions associated with heating requirements for which we are responsible.', 'EMISSIONS AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES The Panel recognizes that CEMEX has exposure to the risk of increased costs linked to carbon regulations, based on its focus on cement production, which is clearly highly carbon-intensive. Adding to this risk, the Panel asserts that ca. 80% of the company’s assets are located in locations with existing or impending carbon regulations. This reality elevates CEMEX’s overall level of risk in this area relative to peers.', 'The inability to reform mortgage markets has dramatically reduced mortgage availability. In fact, our analysis shows that, conservatively, more than $1 trillion in additional mortgage loans might have been made over a five-year period had we reformed our mortgage system. J.P.

These events could result in financial losses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as other damages to the Firm. As reputation risk is inherently difficult to identify, manage, and quantify, an independent reputation risk management governance function is critical.', \"Company may not be able to offset such impact, including, for example, through higher freight rates. Climate change legislation and regulation could also affect CN's customers; make it difficult for CN's customers to produce products in a cost-competitive manner due to increased energy costs; and increase legal costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change.\", 'In addition, we recognize the scientific consensus that climate change is a reality of increasing concern, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming atmosphere and ocean, diminished snow and ice, and sea level rise. We understand that climate change potentially poses a serious financial threat to society as a whole, with implications for the insurance industry in areas such as catastrophe risk perception, pricing and modeling assumptions, particularly if the frequency and severity of natural catastrophic events continue to increase. Because there is significant variability associated with the impacts of climate change, we cannot predict how physical, legal, regulatory and social responses may impact our business.', 'The second half of 2017 had unprecedented weather events, particularly in Florida and the Caribbean.

There may also be consequences for relations with suppliers and intermediaries. For investors, any loss of business or reputation could result in lower returns. PSD2 will increase consumers’ control over financial data, but also their responsibility for this data.', 'Climate change is a long-term risk associated with high uncertainty regarding timing, scope and severity of potential impacts. The risks for insurers can be grouped into physical risks and transition risks. Physical risks relate to losses from climate trends (i.e. changing weather patterns and sea level rise) and climate events (i.e. extreme weather and natural disasters). These physical risks impact property & casualty (P&C) insurance, but also life insurance, for instance through higher than expected mortality rates. Losses can also follow from credit risk and collateral linked to the mortgage portfolio. Aegon is exposed to mortality risk and mortgage underwriting risks and has limited exposure to P&C risk, including catastrophic risk. Beyond insured losses from physical climate damages, climate change can increase uninsured damages and losses and may have disrupting and cascading effects on the wider economy and across the financial system. The second category of risks is associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. These transition risks can affect the value of assets and impact the investments portfolios of insurers. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that Aegon itself is unable to adjust to environmental and sustainability goals. The transition risks are determined by largely uncertain factors such as policy and regulatory changes, political, social and market dynamics and technological innovations. Linked to both the physical and the transition risks, there could be litigation and reputational risks following from not fully considering or responding to the impacts of climate change, or not providing appropriate disclosure of current and future risks. The risks can relate both to Aegon and the companies in which it invests.', \"Limited transportation infrastructure risks The profitability of Equinor’s oil and gas production in a remote area may be affected by an infrastructure constraint Equinor's ability to commercially exploit discovered petroleum resources will depend, among other factors, on infrastructure to transport oil and gas to potential buyers at a commercial price.

The Operational Risk Framework is therefore focused on identifying operational risks, assessing them and managing them within the Barclays Bank Group’s approved risk appetite.', 'We have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our risk management strategies, models and processes, including our use of various risk models for assessing market exposures and hedging strategies, stress testing and other analysis, may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated.', 'Scope 1 emissions come mostly from refrigerant leaks and to a lesser extent from stationary combustion in furnaces. Our Scope 3 emissions result primarily from the production of goods for sale, transportation of products, and waste generated in our operations. We use the GHG Protocol’s Corporate Value Chain methodology (Scope 3) to determine our reporting category.', 'Disappointingly, the vast majority of companies only make generic references to emerging risks when describing their risk management processes. They provide little insight into whether existing risk management processes were sufficient to identify emerging risks or whether they had to flex or amend these processes to do so. They give little information about how emerging risks, once identified, are treated and monitored.', 'Investors are seeking a better understanding of how climate change may impact the company’s business over the short, medium and long term. They also want to know about the company’s planned response, including how it may need to change its strategy.

Carbon emissions have tripled since 1960. We are now consuming about 1.75 times as many natural resources in a year as the planet can possibly regenerate – which is driving land and biodiversity loss, resource shortages and climate change. This is not sustainable, especially with the global population forecast to increase by a further 50% this century. And although people are living longer, they’re not always healthier or happier: there’s been an increase in chronic disease, while mental health issues are also on the rise.', 'Physical risk Physical risks can be acute or chronic. Acute physical risk is caused by extreme weather events such as cyclones and wildfires. Chronic physical risk arises from longer-term shifts in climate patterns such as rising sea levels with time horizon typically spanning decades.

A relatively small number of properties, however, have a high probability of experiencing damage from flooding or drought in that period. Therefore, the impact on an individual household may be significant, even more so if the quality of the property is already low or the household’s response capacity is low (e.g. insufficient wealth or mortgage headroom). Nevertheless this initial analysis does not suggest a significant impact at either a portfolio or bank level.', 'In July 2019, NGO Friends of the Earth Netherlands and its Indonesia and Liberia affiliates notified the Dutch NCP that ING may be in breach of the OECD Guidelines by financing palm oil-related activities.

The credit ratings of these entities may be downgraded due to additional operating expenses resulting from a carbon tax. A credit rating downgrade may reduce the amount of financial leverage we are able to utilize. If this were to occur, our overall profitability could decline.', 'In anticipation of climate change related physical risks, projects related to our investments in particularly vulnerable regions, such as low-lying coastal areas, may face increases in insurance costs. An increase in insurance costs may reduce the cash flows and financial returns from these investments and may cause us to reduce the amount of financial leverage we utilize and cause a decline in our overall profitability.', 'A reduction in GHG emissions relies on the commercial viability and scalability of emission reduction strategies and related technology and products.

The potential regulation may negatively affect the marketing of Cenovus’s bitumen, crude oil or refined products, and may require us to purchase emissions credits in order to affect sales in such jurisdictions. As an oil sands producer, we are not directly regulated and are not expected to have a compliance obligation for carbon intensity reduction requirements for liquid fuels. Refiners, importers, and fuel distributors in these jurisdictions are required to comply with the legislation.', 'DEFINITIONS Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or operated facilities.

Also, not handling the company’s corporate social responsibilities in an informed and good matter is a reputation risk, whereas the opposite is an opportunity.', 'Climate change means climate risk, not only physical risk but also transition risk – the risk associated with economic impacts of the transition to a low carbon economy. Future social developments, climate policy developments and technology developments are subject to high uncertainty, and these factors have a major impact on greenhouse gas emissions. There is also significant uncertainty with regard to how sensitive the climate system is to changes in greenhouse gas emissions, and uncertainty with regard to the effects of a given level of warming.', 'The analysis of economic implications of climate change is fraught with difficulty, and it is impossible to survey all potential impacts of climate change as no existing scenario or model can fully describe the workings of the entire physical world and how all physical, chemical, geological and biological processes influence each other. Impacts of climate changes will thus depend on how rapidly they occur, how large the changes are, as well as the adaptability of societies and ecosystems. As such, many analyses are based on factors that lend themselves to some degree of quantification, but climate change will also have effects which are difficult to quantify, or which cannot meaning- fully be quantified.', '– Commonly used benchmarks are the current climate or the pre-industrial climate situation. Norway will probably experience increased precipitation, more flooding, more frequent landslips and rising sea level, and these physical changes and the uncertainty associated therewith constitute risk factors. Many of the physical processes happen very slowly, from a human perspective. Even if net global emissions were to be reduced to zero within a short space of time, it may therefore take a very long time for the climate system to arrive at a new equilibrium.', 'The two biggest emissions categories are car use and air travel. Compared to 2016, there was a decrease in the category ‘car’ as a result of the switch to electric lease cars. There were more kilometres of air travel in 2019, which resulted in higher CO 2 emissions in this area.', '■ While our facilities and operations are distributed across the globe, we can experience extreme weather, natural disasters, civil unrest, human-made disasters, power outages, pandemic, and other events which can prevent access to, and operations within, the facilities for our employees, partners, and other parties that support our business operations.', 'Creating value Measuring our reputation KPI FY19 FY18 FY17 FY16 FY15 AGL‘s Reptrak score declined since FY18.

Moreover, loss of reputation/brand damage, business interruption, failure to innovate, cyber attack and information security risks stand out as globally emerging risks.', 'Changes in the portfolio’s carbon footprint may occur for two reasons: a change in portfolio composition or a change in the emissions of investee companies. Not until companies reduce their real emissions will we see a reduction of atmospheric carbon and an improvement in the climate. In the past, it was not possible to show the reasons for changes in portfolio carbon footprint. However, the AP funds in 2019 were for the first time able to quantify changes over time in total carbon emissions and portfolio-weighted carbon intensity. Nevertheless, the metrics have limitations that restrict their applicability for measuring total portfolio climate risk and impact. This is because the figures do not, for example, include carbon emissions caused indirectly by investee business activities.', 'LafargeHolcim is exposed to a variety of regulatory frameworks to reduce emissions.

Scientific consensus suggests society is likely to experience devastating impacts as a result of these changes. Current climate models, such as the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model upon which Zurich bases its internal climate scenarios, indicate that physical climate-change risk will begin to rise more materially after the next two decades if left unmitigated.', 'Zurich could be exposed to transition risks if it fails to manage changing market conditions and customer needs as part of the transition to a low-carbon economy, resulting in asset impairment, opportunity cost and lost market share. In a transition scenario, industries unable to de-carbonize could experience declining profitability and lack of re-financing, which could lead to a lack of maintenance with increasing rates of outages and equipment break-downs that translate into higher insurance losses. Failure to manage transition risk could also lead to reputational impacts, both internal and external, resulting from a failure to deliver on publicly stated commitments. Although not considered material in the near-term, the increasing frequency of climate-related legal action suggests climate-related litigation could represent a significant potential risk in the long term.', 'Climate change can pose material risks to sovereign debt due to its impact on national expenditures associated with disaster recovery from extreme weather events or preparedness through climate change mitigation and adaptation projects. Emerging market countries are particularly vulnerable since they often lack capital or have higher funding costs, which exacerbates the myriad risks that they already face. For example, many of these countries are vulnerable to food insecurity from both the impact of climate change on their own agricultural production and higher prices for imports. Our investment team members are increasingly focused on deepening their understanding of environmental risk in sovereigns and its complex links to fiscal and monetary conditions, which in turn affect bond yields and credit ratings.', 'We may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs and the unionization of the Company’s pilots and inflight crewmembers could result in increased labor costs.

The increase of droughts and forest fires due to higher temperatures constitute the biggest risks for forestry.', 'Climate change Climate change exposes UPM to variety of risks, that can be considered strategic, operational, hazard or financial. Strategic risks are related to competition, markets, customers, products and regulation. For example, unpredictable regulation and subsidies may distort raw material and final product markets, and costs of greenhouse gas emissions may influence UPM’s financial performance. However, transition to low-carbon economy should bring business opportunities to UPM’s renewable and recyclable products. Operational risks can be related to supply chain, availability and price of major inputs. Climate change may also cause operational or hazard risk related to exceptional weather events such as more severe storms, floods and draughts resulting in e.g. unpredictable wood harvesting conditions and hydro power availability. Climate change may also contribute to financial risks such as electricity price.', 'RISK TOLERANCE We have a low tolerance for risk, when it comes to protecting the human and environmental resources we all depend on.

Moreover, among disasters associated with climate change, such as floods, storms, drought and heat waves, damage from floods and storms is particularly heavy, and the number of such disasters increased 2.2 times compared with the previous 20 years.', 'In this environment, there are several the Group, as a global distributor, faces due to climate change. These include physical risks with increased likelihood of more extreme events such as storms, and heatwaves which could affect the business’s physical sites or its distribution process. A further risk is regulatory change, often by governments, designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These may render certain products obsolete whilst increasing demand for others. Other potential impacts include increases, for example, in the costs of air transport of inventory to meet customer demands. There is also reputation risk if the business is not seen to be taking deliberate and tangible actions to reduce its GHG emissions.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly introduced an array of new and elevated risks to the safety of our people, the resilience of our operations, the strength of our balance sheet and the financial security of our customers and the community.

This was thanks to their defensive nature. The losses of over 20% at the peak of the coronavirus crisis were moderate by comparison with the wider market. During the second half of the year, however, the HPC (home and personal care) sector, including Beiersdorf’s shares, came under pressure. Lack of transparency around future market developments, fears of recession, and the effects of intense price competition overshadowed the general economic recovery in this period. Nevertheless, Beiersdorf’s shares recovered and again reached the €100 mark for a time. In the final quarter of 2020, our share price was in the €90 to €100 range amid a very volatile market environment. The markets and Beiersdorf’s share price over this period were driven partly by new lock- down restrictions and concerns about the second wave of infection, but also by the progress in developing a vaccine against the coronavirus, which was a source of new knowledge and hope.', 'The Company’s operating environment has continued to trans- form over the years, and our accounting and finance department predecessors navigated these changes by building foundations for financial and capital strategies that remain viable even today.

We had set such targets in the past. However, demand is incredibly volatile in our business; in the mining equipment business, for example, demand can fluctuate by nearly 30%. As a result, past numerical targets have lost their meaning in the first year of the respective three-year plan. Instead of numerical targets, we have therefore chosen to set the more abstract targets of achieving a growth rate above the industry’s average for growth and the industry’s top level for profitability and financial position.', 'Emissions of CH4, which account for approximately 22.2% of our carbon footprint (Scopes 1 and 2), are mainly due to fugitive emissions (15.3%) and natural gas venting (6.9%).

At the same time, developments with miniature real-time clocks, as well as experience gained in this field, are helping Micro Crystal to significantly increase the accuracy of its integrated watch modules. The integration of quartz and an integrated circuit in the same package, along with temperature compensation and other environmental influences, will soon enable Swatch Group brands to produce even more accurate quartz watches. The improved miniature integrated watch modules have extremely low power consumption, which guar- antees long watch battery life. This progress in development was only possible thanks to the close cooperation between Micro Crystal and its sister companies EM Microelectronic and ETA Manufacture Horlogère Suisse.', 'Wood, the building’s leitmotif, is omnipresent, including a symbolic representation with five trees that create a distinctive atmosphere in various parts of the building: Bucida buceras are black olive trees originally native to tropical regions and which can grow to heights of up to two stories.

For Kirin Beverage, decreased sales of canned coffee products were having a relatively large impact on performance because these products are highly profitable. It was able to compensate for these results with growing sales of other products, but finding a way to halt the falling sales of FIRE became a serious issue. Compared with beer brands, devising medium- to long-term marketing strategies for soft drink brands is more difficult as the cycle of releasing new products and renewing existing brands is much faster. Kirin Beverage had been implementing a short-term cycle, as conventionally done by soft drink makers in Japan, but due to the impact of the downward trend in the market, its marketing campaigns were less and less successful. Therefore, in the autumn of 2019, Kirin Beverage adopted Kirin Brewery’s marketing methods to renew FIRE in an effort to restart the brand’s sales growth.', 'We led with purpose and culture, empowering the IBMer at the center of our efforts.
